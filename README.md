#Practical Machine Learning

This repository contains the project writeup for John Hopkin's Practical Machine Learning 
Course. 

The objective of this project is to analyse the Weight Lifting Exercise Data to predict the manner in which they did the exercise.

The output is a report describing how I build my model, how I  use cross validation, what I think the expected out of sample error is, and why I made the choices I did. 

Finally I use my prediction model to predict 20 different test cases in appropriate format to the programming assignment for automated grading.
